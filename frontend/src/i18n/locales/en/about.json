    "title": "The Challenge",
    "paragraph1": "Real-world systems are influenced by many ambiguous circumstances, which complicates planning, modelling, prediction, and decision-making. Decision-making procedures often rely on the opinions of experts who express their standpoints from their own perspective.",
    "paragraph2": "Depending on the structure of expert teams, experts' opinions can vary broadly or may even contradict each other. Finding the best possible compromise of experts' opinions is a basic need in such situations."
  },
  "method": {
    "title": "The BeCoMe Method",
    "paragraph1": "Over many years of research at Czech University of Life Sciences in Prague (CZU), researchers developed the unique BeCoMe (Best-Compromise-Mean) method for determining the optimum group decision, which corresponds to the best compromise/agreement of all experts' opinions.",
    "paragraph2": "The optimum decision is a result of a computationally complex fuzzy set mathematical model based on minimizing entropy. This approach ensures that the final decision represents the most balanced compromise among all expert viewpoints."
